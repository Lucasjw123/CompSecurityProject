# Completed Checklist Items:
## 1. Added a README.md file to the repository that explains the purpose and usage of the code.
## 2. Fixed a security issue related to the usage of uninitialized variables in the constructor.
# Explanation of work completed:

# 1. Added a README.md file that provides a brief introduction to the Circle class and its functionality. The file also includes instructions on how to use the class and its various methods.
## 2. Fixed a security issue where the constructor was not initializing all member variables of the Circle class. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior and should be avoided.

# Next 4 Items:

## 1. Implement a copy constructor and assignment operator for the Circle class.
## 2. Add unit tests to ensure correct functionality of all methods.
## 3. Refactor the Circle class to use smart pointers instead of raw pointers.
## 4. Add support for serialization and deserialization of Circle objects.

# Priority and Difficulty:

## 1. High priority, medium difficulty
## 2. Medium priority, high difficulty
## 3. Low priority, high difficulty
## 4. Medium priority, medium difficulty
